# Ultra-Low-Latency Matching Engine

A deterministic, single-node matching engine implemented with Java 21.

The project is developed in small, verifiable steps:

```text
Correctness
    -> Baseline
    -> Benchmark
    -> Profile
    -> Hypothesis
    -> Optimization
    -> Re-benchmark
```

## Current Stage

Phase 0 - Project Bootstrap.

The repository currently contains:

- Java 21 Maven multi-module build
- Core module compiled from the root `src/` layout
- JUnit 5 test setup
- JMH benchmark module
- Checkstyle validation
- Java version enforcement
- GitHub Actions CI
- Architecture, ADR, benchmark, and performance documentation skeleton

No matching behavior or performance claim has been implemented yet.

## Build

```bash
mvn test
mvn verify
```

## Benchmark

Build the benchmark module:

```bash
mvn verify
```

Run the bootstrap benchmark:

```bash
java -jar benchmark/target/matching-engine-benchmark-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar BootstrapBenchmark
```

Benchmark results are experimental evidence. They must not be presented as system performance until the workload, JVM, hardware, warmup, measurement, and distribution are recorded.

## Structure

```text
.codex/       Project-level agent rules and current context
docs/         Architecture, ADR, benchmark, and performance records
src/          Core production and test source
core/         Maven module that packages the root core source

```

## Engineering Rules

Before changing code, read:

1. `.codex/MASTER_PROMPT.md`
2. `.codex/DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md`
3. `.codex/AGENT_CONTEXT.md`

Every change must be tested, reviewed in Git, committed with a meaningful message, and followed by a clean working-tree check.
